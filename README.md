# Dividend-Stocks-Analyzer

There are countless stocks that pay a dividend, some with a very large dividend yield, and some that demonstrate an increase in the dividend yield over many years. Some stocks have a low yield and low growth, but they pay dividends for decades without being affected by crises or bubbles.

There is no magic formula for choosing the best dividend stocks. Some people prefer one strategy, and some prefer another. In any case, as with everything in life, the most important thing is the data. Unfortunately, in the world of dividends, the data is scattered across many websites, and when you want to make a comparison between 500 different companies, it can be tedious to constantly jump between websites.

One solution is to use Google Sheets and try to import data in a relatively haphazard way. This may work for those who invest and try. The other, better solution is to involve some programming on the subject. The goal of this project is to make all the information we need about dividend stocks easily accessible and readable, and also to make it easy to do sophisticated logic on the information to filter it effectively.

In other words, we will try to combine all the good features of all the websites to create a reliable source for choosing dividend stocks and tracking them. For this purpose, we will use the well-known scripting language Python, and the additional module yfinance.

This simple code project has helped me to easily filter hundreds of companies down to a few tens that are worth further research. The code is modular, and you can easily change the logic to maximize the investment strategy you are interested in.

## Usage
```
pip install yfinance
```
```
python3 main.py
```
